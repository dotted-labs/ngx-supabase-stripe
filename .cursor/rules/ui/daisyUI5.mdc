# daisyUI 5
daisyUI 5 is a CSS library for Tailwind CSS 4
daisyUI 5 provides class names for common UI components

## daisyUI 5 usage rules
1. We can give styles to a HTML element by adding daisyUI class names to it. By adding a component class name, part class names (if there's any available for that component), and modifier class names (if there's any available for that component)
2. Components can be customized using Tailwind CSS utility classes if the customization is not possible using the existing daisyUI classes. For example `btn px-10` sets a custom horizontal padding to a `btn`
3. If customization of daisyUI styles using Tailwind CSS utility classes didn't work because of CSS specificity issues, you can use the `!` at the end of the Tailwind CSS utility class to override the existing styles. For example `btn bg-red-500!` sets a custom background color to a `btn` forcefully. This is a last resort solution and should be used sparingly
4. If a specific component or something similar to it doesn't exist in daisyUI, you can create your own component using Tailwind CSS utility
5. when using Tailwind CSS `flex` and `grid` for layout, it should be responsive using Tailwind CSS responsive utility prefixes.
6. Only allowed class names are existing daisyUI class names or Tailwind CSS utility classes.
7. Ideally, you won't need to write any custom CSS. Using daisyUI class names or Tailwind CSS utility classes is preferred.
8. suggested - if you need placeholder images, use https://picsum.photos/200/300 with the size you want
9. suggested - when designing , don't add a custom font unless it's necessary
10. don't add `bg-base-100 text-base-content` to body unless it's necessary
11. For design decisions, use Refactoring UI book best practices

daisyUI 5 class names are one of the following categories. these type names are only for reference and are not used in the actual code
- `component`: the required component class
- `part`: a child part of a component
- `style`: sets a specific style to component or part
- `behavior`: changes the behavior of component or part
- `color`: sets a specific color to component or part
- `size`: sets a specific size to component or part
- `placement`: sets a specific placement to component or part
- `direction`: sets a specific direction to component or part
- `modifier`: modifies the component or part in a specific way


### daisyUI color rules
1. daisyUI adds semantic color names to Tailwind CSS colors
2. daisyUI color names can be used in utility classes, like other Tailwind CSS color names. for example, `bg-primary` will use the primary color for the background
3. daisyUI color names include variables as value so they can change based the theme
4. There's no need to use `dark:` for daisyUI color names
5. Ideally only daisyUI color names should be used for colors so the colors can change automatically based on the theme
6. If a Tailwind CSS color name (like `red-500`) is used, it will be same red color on all themes
7. If a daisyUI color name (like `primary`) is used, it will change color based on the theme
8. Using Tailwind CSS color names for text colors should be avoided because Tailwind CSS color `text-gray-800` on `bg-base-100` would be unreadable on a dark theme - because on dark theme, `bg-base-100` is a dark color
9. `*-content` colors should have a good contrast compared to their associated colors
10. suggestion - when designing a page use `base-*` colors for majority of the page. use `primary` color for important elements
